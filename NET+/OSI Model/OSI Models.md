OSI (Open System Interconnection) Model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network .It was developed by ISO  , It has Seven Layers . it provides clear structure for data transmission and managing network issues 


Types of OSI Layers

- **1. [[Physical Layer]]:** Bits & hardware — jamming, physical tampering  
- **2. [[Data Link Layer]]:** Frames & MACs — ARP spoofing, MAC spoofing  
- **3. [[Network Layer]]:** IP routing — IP spoofing, ICMP floods  
- **4. [[Transport Layer]]:** Ports & reliability — SYN floods, UDP floods  
- **5. [[Session Layer]]:** Session control — session hijacking  
- **6. [[Presentation Layer]]:** Data translation — SSL stripping, TLS downgrade  
- **7. [[Application Layer]]:** App protocols — DNS spoofing, phishing, SQLi
