### NAS (Network Attached Storage)
- File-level storage over standard networks  
- Accessible via protocols like SMB, NFS  
- Ideal for home or small business file sharing

### SAN (Storage Area Network)
- Block-level storage over high-speed network (e.g. Fibre Channel)  
- Used in enterprise environments for databases, VMs

**Comparison:**  
- NAS = simpler, cheaper, file-based  
- SAN = faster, complex, block-based

**Security Concerns:**  
- Access controls  
- Encryption  
- Lateral movement via storage access
