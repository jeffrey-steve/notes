**Function:**  
- Filters incoming/outgoing traffic based on rules

**Key Concepts:**  
- Stateful vs. Stateless inspection  
- ACLs (Access Control Lists)  
- Can operate at  [[Network Layer]], [[Transport Layer]], [[Application Layer]] (depends on type)

**Types:**  
- Hardware/Software  
- Network-based, Host-based  
- Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFW)

**Examples:**  
- Block port 23 (Telnet), allow port 443 (HTTPS)

**Common Attacks:**  
- Rule misconfigurations  
- Firewall evasion techniques (e.g. tunneling)
