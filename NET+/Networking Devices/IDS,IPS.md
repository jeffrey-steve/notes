**Function:**  
- IDS: Monitors network for suspicious activity  
- IPS: Blocks detected threats in real time

**Key Concepts:**  
- Signature-based vs. Anomaly-based detection  
- Inline (IPS) vs. Passive (IDS)  
- False positives & negatives

**Examples:**  
- Detect SQL injection  
- Block brute-force login attempts

**Security Considerations:**  
- Sensor placement  
- Detection bypassing via obfuscation
